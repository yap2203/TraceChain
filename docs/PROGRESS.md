# Project Progress

## 2026-11-07 — Stakeholder audit reports connected to chain

- Replaced the fabricated stakeholder product-history report with an authenticated, wallet-scoped snapshot from the configured ingredient, product, custody-transfer, and evidence registries.
- Added current lifecycle states, quantities, resolved company names, integrity hashes, refresh, print, CSV export, service-error handling, and honest empty states without inventing transaction hashes or verification outcomes.
- Added regression coverage proving that on-chain records render and former sample product data does not.
## 2026-11-07 — Distributor-to-Retailer custody transfer

- Replaced the Distributor transfer fixtures, hardcoded company identities, simulated timer, and fake QR transfer ID with authenticated inventory and verified Retailer APIs.
- Added positive-available-inventory filtering, active Retailer directory resolution, Distributor and Retailer permission checks, product/inventory/date validation, encrypted shipment details, idempotent transfer IDs, unsigned `createTransfer` preparation, and authoritative post-mining verification.
- Added the MetaMask review/submission flow, real QR and PNG rendering, company-first presentation, collapsible technical identifiers, duplicate-submit protection, and post-write inventory/history refresh.
- Added focused API and frontend tests for inventory filtering, roles, inactive recipients, insufficient inventory, exact transaction inputs, verified completion, recipient wallet retention, real QR IDs, and duplicate submission.

## 2026-11-07 — Company Digital Identity Card

- Added authenticated retrieval of selected claims from the current wallet's actual server-managed encrypted Company Role VC.
- Added explicit user-triggered Veramo and registry verification with individual signature, issuer, wallet/DID, role, date, hash, lifecycle/replacement, and authorization results.
- Reworked the shared stakeholder credential view into a responsive Company Digital Identity Card with accessible copy actions, separate lifecycle/cryptographic states, collapsed technical details, and a generated PDF identity summary.
- Added cross-wallet isolation, lifecycle-state, identity rendering/copying, verification failure, missing-service, and summary-content tests without changing SIWE login or contracts.

## 2026-11-07 — Stakeholder credential pages connected to chain

- Replaced the Supplier, Manufacturer, Distributor, and Retailer credential-page fixtures with a shared authenticated page backed by `GET /api/blockchain/credentials/me`.
- Added current-wallet credential and stakeholder reads without accepting a caller-selected address.
- Removed fake DIDs, transaction hashes, block numbers, company identities, and always-valid verification labels; the UI now distinguishes authoritative registry state from optional private issuance metadata and off-chain cryptographic verification.

## 2026-11-07 — Verified stakeholder identity presentation

- Added a reusable stakeholder directory backed by existing Company Role issuance records and the live fail-closed registry authorization resolver; revoked or stale entries are excluded, legacy names fall back safely, and duplicate names are disambiguated with shortened wallets.
- Added verified company names to authorized session responses and workspace identity areas, with optional Account details and a plain Sign out action.
- Enriched authenticated operational, evidence, recipient, and custody-transfer responses with safe company display names while preserving wallet addresses for authorization and MetaMask transaction recipients.
- Updated stakeholder, transfer, evidence, and receipt presentation so company names are primary and technical identifiers are available through collapsible copyable details.
- Added API and frontend regression coverage for resolution, revoked exclusion, fallback, duplicates, session enrichment, recipient values, transaction recipients, and technical disclosure.

## 2026-11-07 — Administrator credential on-chain linkage

- Added an authenticated Admin workflow that retrieves the cryptographically verified bootstrap Company Role VC, encrypts and pins it off-chain, and prepares separate MetaMask transactions for `CredentialRegistry` registration and `StakeholderRegistry` reference linkage.
- Added the Admin credential to the credential-management journal so its lifecycle is read from the same on-chain records as Supplier, Manufacturer, Distributor, and Retailer credentials.
- Added linked Admin credential identifiers to refreshed SIWE authorization summaries while retaining the constructor-admin bootstrap recovery path.

## Completed foundation

- Created the TypeScript npm monorepo with `apps/*` and `packages/*` workspaces.
- Added React/Vite frontend, Express API, shared, SSI, and contract package boundaries.
- Added repository formatting, environment templates, ignore rules, and documentation structure.
- Consolidated frontend, API, blockchain, and SSI configuration into one ignored root `.env` with one tracked root template and deterministic loaders for both applications.
- Implemented the responsive TraceChain landing page, branding, registration shell, and role route hierarchy.
- Replaced the registration preview with the complete three-step company onboarding interface, including wallet association, supporting-document validation, review, and declaration.
- Persisted company name and registration number against the application ID/profile hash so new Admin credential-issuance forms populate these reviewed values automatically.
- Added environment-driven local-chain configuration, MetaMask network switching for chain 31337, real local company-application transactions, and an API endpoint that checks bytecode at all six configured contract addresses.
- Implemented ERC-4361 wallet authentication with MetaMask and Sepolia.
- Added the official MetaMask Connect EVM adapter with accessible Browser extension and Mobile QR tabs, including explicit mobile transport selection when an extension or previous extension session exists.
- Added five-minute address-bound nonces, signature validation, single-use nonce handling, HttpOnly-cookie sessions, restoration, logout, and 13 authentication tests.
- Added repository interfaces and process-local development implementations for nonces and sessions.
- Added `POST /api/ssi/company-role/verify`, authenticated credential presentation, safe session restoration, and logout cleanup.
- Added a JSON credential picker that does not use browser storage and reports verification results without exposing JWT material.
- Added shared role-to-workspace mapping and fail-closed production workspace guards; local verification still cannot authorize access.
- Added a development-only Admin holder export command with overwrite protection.
- Added 8 SSI presentation API tests and 3 workspace access tests.
- Added the versioned custody-transfer QR locator codec, safe error codes, canonical normalization,
  and focused shared-package tests. The QR contains only chain, contract, and transfer references.
- Added authenticated custody-transfer QR resolution with configured chain/contract matching,
  read-only `getTransfer` lookup, intended-recipient enforcement, minimal safe responses, and 11
  injected-gateway API tests.
- Added canonical QR rendering and PNG download plus camera, image-file, and manual-paste scanning.
  Distributor and Retailer receipt screens now show transfer data only after authenticated API
  resolution and release camera resources deterministically.
- Added a chain-31337-only seed command that reuses the configured deployed contracts and unlocked
  Hardhat accounts to create one real Manufacturer-to-Distributor `AwaitingReceipt` transfer.
- Added recipient-only receipt confirmation: the API revalidates authorization and returns unsigned
  calldata, MetaMask submits it, the UI waits for the receipt, and the API refreshes the confirmed
  contract record. QR scanning remains read-only.
- Expanded the custody-transfer API suite to 16 injected-gateway tests, including exact
  `confirmReceipt` calldata encoding without a live RPC.
- Implemented the real Manufacturer-to-Distributor production workflow: encrypted challenge-bound
  evidence requests, Supplier full-credential JWT VPs, cryptographic/on-chain evidence acceptance,
  accepted-ingredient product creation, active-Distributor transfer creation, and QR rendering from
  the verified real `AwaitingReceipt` transfer ID.
- Added authenticated `/api/production-flow` reads and unsigned transaction-preparation endpoints,
  current role/credential/permission rechecks, ignored restart-resumable workflow records, and safe
  failure handling that never returns plaintext credentials, VPs, encryption keys, or private metadata.

## Current frontend version

- Integrated all approved stakeholder screens into the canonical admin, supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and retailer routes.
- Organized screens by role and workflow, with separate receipt, report, and shared UI folders.
- Removed the former UI-preview route and role selector.
- Added responsive workspace navigation, Lucide icons, scoped light/dark themes, centered accessible loading states, and viewport-safe dialogs.
- Added shared client-side table pagination with 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-record page-size options.
- Replaced mandatory Company Role VC upload during login with MetaMask SIWE plus direct, fail-closed registry authorization. Sessions now distinguish wallet authentication, current on-chain authorization, and optional off-chain VC verification; authorization is refreshed on restoration and protected operations.
- Removed the temporary account-free localhost bypass; local workspaces now require wallet, credential, and on-chain authorization.
- Replaced Admin overview and company-application fixtures with authenticated API-gateway StakeholderRegistry reads, real empty/error states, and a MetaMask-signed on-chain rejection action.
- Centralized contract addresses and ABIs in the API; live frontend writes now request validated unsigned transaction data and retain the stakeholder wallet as `msg.sender` through MetaMask.
- Completed the company approval path with authority-signed Company Role Credential issuance, backend-prepared credential registration and stakeholder approval transactions, sequential Admin MetaMask confirmation, and credential JSON download for holder delivery.
- Replaced the Admin credential-management fixtures with live CredentialRegistry records and MetaMask-signed suspend, reactivate, and permanent-revoke actions; authorization now rejects non-active registry credentials.
- Replaced Admin Access Control fixtures with live stakeholder and credential lifecycle records, MetaMask-signed stakeholder suspend/reactivate/revoke actions, live role counts, and a configurable on-chain role-permission matrix; replaced the Admin audit fixture with exportable registry snapshots.
- Added authenticated, wallet-scoped operational reads across IngredientRegistry, ProductRegistry, EvidenceRegistry, and CustodyTransfer. Supplier, Manufacturer, Distributor, and Retailer primary dashboards, batch/shipment/inventory lists, and their detail views now display current chain state instead of sample records.
- Made Company Role Credential issuance durable and idempotent: generated VCs are verified before use, deterministically hashed, AES-256-GCM encrypted, pinned through an injectable IPFS gateway, and persisted for restart-safe partial-failure recovery.
- Added cancellable mobile-wallet guidance, connection rejection/expiry handling, wallet transport cleanup on logout, and lazy initialization that leaves session restoration non-interactive.
- Reused existing authorized extension providers, serialized connection attempts, added bounded timeouts and one stale-transport retry, and moved connection progress into the visible authentication card.
- Added mocked MetaMask client, EIP-1193 provider, transport-tab, QR-selection, stale-session, timeout, StrictMode, listener-cleanup, custody-transfer QR, receipt-confirmation, Supplier registration, production-flow, and stakeholder identity-card tests; the frontend suite now contains 71 tests and performs no live relay or RPC calls.
- Validated all 29 workspace pages at 320, 390, 768, and 1440 pixel widths, including canonical navigation, pagination, filters, dialogs, local access, and production denial.

## Current contract and SSI version

- Added a Hardhat 3 workspace using Solidity 0.8.34, ethers, Mocha, Ignition, and Foundry-compatible Solidity tests.
- Implemented StakeholderRegistry, CredentialRegistry, EvidenceRegistry, IngredientRegistry, ProductRegistry, and CustodyTransfer contracts with role/status enforcement and bounded paginated registry reads.
- Added application review, additional-evidence, resubmission, reviewed role-change, wallet replacement, credential lifecycle, ingredient/product linkage, evidence acceptance, and custody discrepancy workflows.
- Added one Ignition module that deploys and wires the complete suite and a TypeScript integration test covering authorization, credential lifecycle, traceability, reservation accounting, and duplicate-receipt protection.
- Separated pre-consumption ingredient usability from post-consumption traceability validity, so a
  finished product remains transferable after consuming the final ingredient unit while ingredient
  lifecycle, Supplier authorization, and credential validity still gate transfer.
- Confirmed production contracts compile with the cached native Solidity 0.8.34 compiler and the
  complete Hardhat suite passes locally.
- Added AES-256-GCM encrypted JSON content storage with an injectable IPFS pinning gateway and tamper-detection tests.
- Implemented the Supplier Ingredient Credential and batch workflow: Supplier-specific issuer DIDs,
  typed W3C JWT claims, immediate cryptographic verification, canonical SHA-256 hashes, encrypted
  IPFS storage, and restart-resumable workflow records.
- Added authenticated `POST /api/ingredient-batches/prepare` and `GET /api/ingredient-batches`.
  The API rechecks Supplier role/status and both contract permissions, prepares credential and batch
  writes sequentially, and verifies each on-chain record before advancing or reporting completion.
- Replaced the Supplier ingredient registration timer and batch fixtures in the registration,
  list, detail, and overview screens with the real two-transaction MetaMask workflow and
  event/getBatch-backed API data. Errors remain resumable and duplicate submissions are blocked.
- Added 4 Ingredient Credential SSI cases, 6 focused ingredient-batch API cases, and 4 Supplier
  frontend workflow/list cases, all using mocked external services or local cryptographic agents.
- Implemented a Veramo 7 server-side agent with DID, resolver, key-management, JWT VC/VP, verification, and JSON data-store plugins.
- Added `did:ethr` Sepolia authority creation, separate atomic JSON stores, and SecretBox encryption for private issuer keys.
- Added typed Company Role Credential issuance and verification with trusted issuer, subject/SIWE wallet binding, shared roles, date, local status, and deterministic SHA-256 checks.
- Added an idempotent Product Traceability Authority and bootstrap System Admin service plus a safe CLI command.
- Added 21 offline SSI tests, including successful challenge-bound Ingredient VP verification plus challenge/signature rejection, without live RPC, MetaMask, or test ETH.
- Connected credential presentation to on-chain stakeholder role/lifecycle and credential hash/status checks; authorized sessions now set `onChainStatusChecked` and `authorizationReady` to true.

## Remaining work

- Select the database and replace process-local nonce and session storage.
- Replace prototype filesystem issuance metadata and Veramo JSON key storage with production-managed database and key-management services.
- Replace the remaining QR/history, receipt-evidence/reconciliation, and non-admin report fixtures with authenticated chain-backed workflows.
- Complete a clean Hardhat test run and deploy the suite to Sepolia when the deployment wallet is ready.
- Add damaged/rejected quantity reconciliation and encrypted receipt evidence to receipt confirmation.
- Add committed end-to-end browser tests and production deployment configuration.

## Important distinction

The Admin application, credential, access-control, and audit screens use authoritative chain records. Primary Supplier, Manufacturer, Distributor, and Retailer dashboards and their batch, product, shipment, inventory, detail, and company-identity views are backed by authenticated services. Supplier Ingredient Credential/batch registration and the Manufacturer evidence, product, Manufacturer-to-Distributor transfer, Distributor-to-Retailer transfer, QR handoff, and recipient-confirmation flows use verified credentials, encrypted IPFS content, MetaMask, contract events, and authoritative reads. QR product history, receipt reconciliation/evidence, and non-admin reports remain presentation fixtures until their transaction and encrypted-content integrations are completed.
